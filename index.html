        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a software engineer based in Germany with over a decade of experience building systems that handle real complexity — payment platforms, energy markets, telecom infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Currently at ClimatePartner, where I work on architecture decisions, shared libraries, and helping teams ship better software. Previously built Germany's 3rd largest retail payment platform at MediaMarktSaturn.</p>
        <p>I write about backend engineering, cloud architecture, and the occasional frontend adventure on this blog.</p>
