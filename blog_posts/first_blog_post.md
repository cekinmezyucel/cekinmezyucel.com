# Welcome to my blog!

Hello, folks! This is my first blog post.

I am a backend oriented software engineer, this personal website is a challenge for me to learn frontend development from scratch.

This is why I started this site with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will gradually introduce frameworks and libraries if I need them.

I will write about my journey, the challenges I face, and the solutions I find.

Hopefully, this blog will be a good resource for beginners who want to learn frontend development and for experienced developers who want to see how a backend developer learns frontend development. LOL

I will also write about my thoughts on software engineering, programming, and technology in general.

See you in the next post!
